# python-side-projects

I wrote simple python scripts to solve some real problems in work:

> Note: My scripts use python3.

- Append a string (or insert a line) to all markdown files in a given folder: [insert-string.py](/insert-string.py)

- Walk through all markdown files in a given folder and check if each of the file links is in another file (e.g. TOC.md): [find-string.py](/find-string.py)
