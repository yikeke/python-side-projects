# python-side-projects

I wrote simple python scripts to solve some real problems in work:

> Note: My scripts use python3.

- Insert a line (or insert a string to a line) to all markdown files in a root folder

- Walk through all markdown files in a given folder and see if each of the file links is in another file (e.g. TOC.md) [find-string.py](/find-string.py)
