# python-side-projects

I wrote simple python scripts to solve some real problems in work:

> Note: My scripts use python3.

- [insert-string.py](/insert-string.py): Append a string (or insert a line) to all markdown files in a given folder

- [find-string.py](/find-string.py): Walk through all markdown files in a given folder and check if each of the file links is in another file (e.g. TOC.md)

- Track all github issues and pull requests in Google Sheet

- Check all github pull requests that are opened before a specific date and do not have a label that matches the pattern `translation/xxx`
